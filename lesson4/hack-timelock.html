<h1>Lab 4: Hack TimeLock</h1>

<div>Write a single-use solidity contract to steal funds from the following <code>TimeLock</code> contract. Your submission should be the solidity program.</div>

<pre>
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

contract TimeLock {
    uint256 public unlockTime;
    
    constructor() public payable {
        unlockTime = block.timestamp + (365 * 86400); // 1 year
    }
    
    function increaseUnlockTime(uint256 numSeconds) public {
        unlockTime += numSeconds;
    }
    
    function claim() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "please send along 1 ETH to claim");
        if (block.timestamp &gt;= unlockTime) {
            msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<ul>

<li>TimeLock is a contract that locks up a certain amount of ETH (which was added when it was created). This ETH can only be redeemed after a period of time has elapsed.</li>

<li>Look closely at TimeLock to see if you can find any vulnerabilities. Is it necessary to wait a whole year before claiming?</li>

<li>Note that to attempt a claim you need to send along 1 ETH. This is dangerous: What if somebody calls increaseUnlockTime before your transaction is mined? You will lose 1 ETH! Is there any way to protect against this?</li>

</ul>
