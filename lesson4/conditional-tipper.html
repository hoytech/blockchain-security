<h1>Exercise: Conditional Tipper</h1>


<ul>

<li>Let's say there is a crowd-funding campaign backed by a <code>Tipjar</code> contract. Lots of people are sending tips to it. Suppose you don't want to tip the campaign if they've already reached their funding goal. Since you don't know when your transaction will get processed, or whose transactions will come ahead of yours, you can't reliably calculate your tip beforehand.</li>

<li>In the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org">remix IDE</a>, deploy the TipJar contract you created in <a href="../lesson3/tipjar.html">a previous lab</a>. Then use the following single-use contract to make sure that your tip doesn't bring the tipjar's balance over some specified amount.

<pre>
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract ConditionalTipper {
    constructor(address payable tipjar, uint256 limit)
                  public payable {
        if (tipjar.balance < limit) {
            tipjar.transfer(limit - tipjar.balance);
        }

        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }
}
</pre>

</li>

<li>Note that the constructor is payable, and you need to send some ETH in when you deploy the contract. However, you will get refunded any amount that wasn't sent as a tip.</li>

<li>What happens if your contract tries to tip more than you sent in?</li>

</ul>
