<h1>Lab 6: Hack SimpleDAO</h1>

<div>Write an attack contract in solidity to steal funds from the following <code>SimpleDAO</code> contract. Your submission should be the solidity program.</div>

<pre>
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract SimpleDAO {
    mapping(address => uint) public balance;
 
    function deposit() public payable {
        balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
       require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "not enough balance");
       msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
       balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
</pre>

<ul>

<li>Create an interface so it's easy to call methods on the SimpleDAO contract. Note: in interfaces you need to change <code>public</code> to <code>external</code></li>

<li>Your attack contract will need to have a fallback method, and probably also another method to trigger the attack.</li>

<li>You can <b>not</b> use a single-use contract for this hack since your contract's fallback function doesn't exist until the constructor returns. But you can still <code>selfdestruct()</code> the contract later if you want.</li>

<li>Be careful not to transfer too much out of the SimpleDAO. If you try to transfer more than its entire balance, your transaction will fail.</li>

<li>For testing, deploy the SimpleDAO contract and deposit some funds. Then, with a separate account, steal the funds deposited by the original user.</li>

</ul>
