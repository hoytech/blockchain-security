## Introduction to Blockchain Security Practices

### Lesson 4: Smart Contract Security

*Doug Hoyte, March 2019*

[https://is.gd/blockchainsec](https://is.gd/blockchainsec)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Lesson Topics

* Threat models
* Contract interactions
* On-chain randomness
* Re-entrancy

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Threat models

* Model 1: Contract writer is trusted
  * Must worry about all bugs we've discussed so far (overflows, function visibility, etc)
* Model 2: Contract writer may be malicious
  * Must worry about everything in model 1, as well as possibility contract writer added a hidden back-door
    * *Underhanded* contracts

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Obvious back-door

<pre class="hljs js">
    function soLongSuckers() public onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
</pre>

<img src="solongsuckers.png" />

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What about this?

<pre class="hljs js">
    uint256 ownerReward;

    function claimOwnerReward(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= ownerReward, "too much");
        ownerReward =- amount;
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Plausible deniability

<pre class="hljs js">
    uint256 ownerReward;

    function claimOwnerReward(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= ownerReward, "too much");
        ownerReward <span class="highlightRed">=-</span> amount;
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

* Should be `-=`, not `=-`
* This bug lets owner steal all ETH in contract
  * How?
* If detected beforehand, owner can claim:
  * *Oops sorry. It was just a typo, I wasn't trying to steal anything, I promise*

</script></section>







<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Autonomous agents

* A contract is an independent entity
  * Has an ETH balance
  * Has code, which cannot be changed
  * Lives forever (unless they `selfdestruct`)
  * Can send and receive ETH
  * Can call functions in other contracts
  * Can create other contracts
* This is the main reason Ethereum is interesting

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Contract interactions

* EOA sends ETH to an EOA
  * Simple value transfer, no code run
* EOA calls contract
  * Called contract runs code which can:
    * Send ETH
    * Call other contracts
    * Create contracts

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Contract upgrades

* Some contracts are designed to be *upgradeable*
  * **Good**: Owner can fix bugs in the contract before bad guys can exploit them
  * **Bad**: If owner is a bad guy, can add back-doors
* Because a contract's code cannot be changed, upgradeable contracts are implemented using *proxy contracts* (contracts that call other contracts)
  * An upgrade changes the contract address that the proxy will call

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## transfer is a function call

* Recall that a transaction can do either or both:
  * Send ETH
  * Invoke a function on a contract
* When you call `someAddr.transfer()` you are:
  * Sending ETH
  * *and* invoking the target's fallback function (if it is a contract)

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Forwarding gas

* When you call another contract, you can choose how much gas to "forward" to it
  * Forward just means the maximum amount of your own gas you are letting it consume
* `transfer` forwards 2,300 gas
  * Small amount: Just enough for the fallback function to log an event
  * Not enough to do things like write to storage

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Different ways to send ETH

* `address.transfer(amount)`
  * Throws error on failure
  * Forwards 2,300 gas
* `address.send(amount)`
  * <span class="highlightRed">Returns false on failure</span>
  * Forwards 2,300 gas
* `address.call.value(amount)("")`
  * <span class="highlightRed">Returns false on failure</span>
  * <span class="highlightRed">Forwards all available gas</span>

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Transfer to a contract

* Suppose your contract sends two payouts:
<pre class="hljs js">
    addr1.transfer(payout1);
    addr2.transfer(payout2);
</pre>
* If `addr2` is the address of a contract, it could have a fallback function like this:
<pre class="hljs js">
    function () {
        require(false);
    }
</pre>
* So, `addr2` causes whole transaction to fail, including payout to `addr1`
  * Real-life example: [King of the Ether bug](https://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Withdrawal pattern

* It is better to record how much is owed to each address:
<pre class="hljs js">
    owed[addr1] += payout1;
    owed[addr2] += payout2;
</pre>
* Then let each address withdraw their payouts in separate transactions:
<pre class="hljs js">
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = owed[msg.sender];
        owed[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
</pre>

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Interfaces

* An interface is an abstract contract definition that only contains function *signatures*:
<pre class="hljs js">
interface VaultInterface {
    function balance() external view returns(uint256);
    function deposit() external payable;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
}
</pre>
* Then in your contract, you can convert an `address` to the interface and call functions on it:
<pre class="hljs js">
    VaultInterface v = VaultInterface(vaultAddr);
    uint256 myBalance = v.balance(address(this));
    v.deposit.value(1 ether)();
    v.withdraw(1 ether);
</pre>

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Single-use contracts

<pre class="hljs js">
contract SingleUseContract {
    constructor() public payable {

        // do operations

        <span class="highlight">selfdestruct(msg.sender);</span>
    }
}
</pre>

* Perform operations in a contract's constructor, and then `selfdestruct` when finished
  * One of the few valid use cases for `selfdestruct`: gas refund for single-use contracts
* Like a "throw-away account"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Atomic operations

<pre class="hljs js">
contract BankFundsMover {
    constructor(BankInterface bank1, BankInterface bank2) public {  
        bank1.withdraw(1 ether);
        bank2.deposit.value(1 ether)();

        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }
}
</pre>

* Either **both** the withdrawal and deposit will happen, or **neither** will
  * Actions execute as an **atomic unit**
* No other transaction can sneak in between the withdrawal and deposit
  * Funds will never be outside a bank

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Condition checking

<pre class="hljs js">
contract ConditionalTipper {
    constructor(address payable tipjar, uint256 limit)
                  public payable {
        if (tipjar.balance < limit) {
            tipjar.transfer(limit - tipjar.balance);
        }

        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }
}
</pre>

* Send a tip to a Tipjar (Lab #3), but make sure its balance doesn't exceed some limit amount
* Could check before sending transaction, but balance might change after that
  * If somebody else's transaction mined first

</script></section>

## Beating the house

* Many dApps that depend on randomness have [been found vulnerable](https://blog.positive.com/predicting-random-numbers-in-ethereum-smart-contracts-e5358c6b8620)
* How about the Coin Flip Game contracts we implemented in the previous lab?
  * Consider what is possible with a single-use contract
    * Note that conditions can be checked after calling a contract, and can optionally revert the entire transaction

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Detecting contract callers

* Can we detect if the caller is a contract instead of an EOA?
* Attempt 1 (from [Fomo 3D](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/916xni/how_to_pwn_fomo3d_a_beginners_guide/)):
<pre class="hljs js">
    modifier isHuman() {
      address _addr = msg.sender;
      uint256 _codeLength;

      assembly {_codeLength := extcodesize(_addr)}
      require(_codeLength == 0, "sorry humans only");
      _;
    }
</pre>

  * Doesn't work: code size is 0 inside a contract's constructor

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Detecting contract callers (2)

* Attempt 2:
<pre class="hljs js">  
    modifier isHuman() {
      require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "sorry humans only");
      _;
    }
</pre>

  * Works, but:
    * "Legitimate" contract users cannot use your contract (ex: multi-sig wallets)
    * Ethereum will eventually get rid of `tx.origin`
      * Account abstraction

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## On-chain randomness

* Blockchains are global, deterministic data-structures
* Generating something unpredictable is impossible
  * Everybody needs to generate the same value

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Miner attacks

* Even if you block contracts from calling it, your coin flip game is still vulnerable to miners
* Miners control the exact construction of a block
  * They can simulate running a transaction that bets on the Coin Flip Game
  * Only include it in their blocks if it will win

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commitment schemes

* All is not lost...
* There *is* a way to create secure randomness on-chain: *commit-reveal protocol*
  * Cryptographic protocol for 2 or more parties to come to a consensus on a value they all can agree is random
  * 2 phases: commit phase, reveal phase

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commit phase

* Assume two parties: A, B
* Each generates a secret random value
  * A generates r<sub>A</sub>
  * B generates r<sub>B</sub>
* They exchange hashes of their secrets
  * A sends H(r<sub>A</sub>) to B
  * B sends H(r<sub>B</sub>) to A
* Commit phase ends and reveal phase begins...

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Reveal phase

* They now exchange their random values and verify the hashes
  * Now that r<sub>B</sub> is public, A computes H(r<sub>B</sub>) and verifies it's same as was received in commit phase
  * B does the same with r<sub>A</sub>
* Now that both parties have securely shared r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub>, these values are combined into the final output
  * Ways to combine: xor ($\oplus$), `+`, `H(A . B)`
</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Commit-reveal security

* This works because the randomness depends on both r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub>
* Each party needs to commit to their random number before they can see the other random numbers
* As long as there is sufficient block-time between the commit and reveal phases, miners have no influence

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Failure to reveal

* During the reveal phase, one party will see the other revealed numbers first
* If this party's outcome is bad, they could choose to not reveal their secret number
* The punishment for failing to reveal should be at least as bad as a losing outcome
  * Same for other protocol violations
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Copied commitment

* During the commit phase, one party could submit *the same hash* as the other party
  * Depending on how the secrets are combined, output may be predictable
    * $r \oplus r = 0$
    * $r + r \bmod 2 = 0$
  * Solution: Use non-predictable combine method, or prevent copied commitments in the protocol

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## 15 minute break

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-entrancy

* When a contract calls itself (usually indirectly)
* If a contract is in the middle of an operation and it unexpectedly starts a new operation, this can be security problem
* Typical flow:
  * Contract A calls contract B
  * Contract B calls *back into* contract A

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Global variables

* Global variables are usually the root of the problem
* Contract storage is a global variable
  * It could be in an inconsistent state when calling other contracts
* Not specific to smart contracts
  * Any programming language with callbacks and global variables has this issue

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Deadlock (pseudo-code)

    let globalLock = false;

    function doOperation(callback) {
        waitForGlobalLock();
        globalLock = true;

        let result = doSomeStuff();
        callback(result);

        globalLock = false;
    }

Suppose it's called like this:

    doOperation((result) => {
        doOperation((result) => {
            console.log("Did 2 operations");
        });
    });

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The DAO

* "Decentralized Autonomous Organization"
* Basically a corporation, but on the blockchain
* Was hacked for $50M
  * Most famous Ethereum security bug
  * Resulted in Ethereum Classic fork
  * Bug was due to unanticipated re-entrancy

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The DAO Bug

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
       require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "no balance");
       msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");
       balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

* As mentioned, `.call` forwards unlimited gas
  * So, if `msg.sender` is a contract, its fallback function can do lots of stuff
  * Including calling `withdraw` *again*
    * Try to walk through what would happen

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Attack call-stack

<pre class="hljs js">
Hacker contract: <span class="highlightRed">dao.deposit.value(10)()</span>
Hacker contract: <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:   msg.sender.transfer(10)
Hacker fallback:     <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:       msg.sender.transfer(10)
Hacker fallback:         <span class="highlightRed">dao.withdraw(10)</span>
        The DAO:           msg.sender.transfer(10)
        The DAO:           balance[msg.sender] -= 10
        The DAO:       balance[msg.sender] -= 10
        The DAO:   balance[msg.sender] -= 10
</pre>

* Hacker deposits 10 but withdraws 30

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Limit forwarded gas

* If all you want to do is send ETH, use `transfer` since it limits the amount of gas available to the fallback
  * 2,300 gas is just enough to log, but not enough to do bad things like write to storage
* You can also manually limit the gas forwarded:
      someContract.someFunc.gas(10000)();

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-entrancy guard

<pre class="hljs js">
    bool private locked = false;

    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "re-entrancy detected");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
</pre>

* Good solution, but adds 5,000 gas to each call
  * Will be almost free if [EIP-1283](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1283.md) deployed

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Preserve invariants

* Best solution: helps in many ways
* An invariant is something that should always be true
* In the DAO example, the invariant is that `balance[msg.sender]` always holds the amount owed to `msg.sender`
  * Violated: Contract balance was debited but `balance` mapping in storage was not
* Always leave storage in a consistent state when calling other contracts

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Checks-Effects-Interactions

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
       // Checks
       require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "no balance");

       // Effects
       balance[msg.sender] -= amount;

       // Interactions
       msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

* Called the [CEI pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)
* Note the order of last two operations was swapped from The DAO's version

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Beware optimizations

* [Serious bug](https://medium.com/@richmcateer_93513/compounds-self-liquidation-bug-829d6571c2df) in Compound money market contract
* Partially caused by minimizing the number of writes to storage as gas optimization
* Always try to preserve invariants
