blockchain crypto primitives
  * randomness
    * bias
    * predictability
  * computational infeasability
  * hash functions
    * pigeon-hole principle
    * preimage vs. collision resistance
    * fuzzy hashes
    * birthday attacks
    * length extension attacks
    * rho method
  * signatures
    * elliptic curves
    * how are ethereum addresses generated
    * HID wallets
      * how they are basically CSPRNGs

  * assignment: Take home problem: Generate an ethereum address that starts with 0x1234




blockchain architecture
  * role of miners
  * account-based versus UTXO
  * consensus
    * complete determinism
  * gas
  * storage
    * merkle trees
  * transactions
    * structure of transactions
    * errors
  * ecrecover
  * EVM
  * smart contracts
  * solidity
  * solidity ABI
  * function selectors
  * revert/assert/require
  * ganache



smart contract security
  * attack model
    * third-party
    * underhanded
  * upgradability
  * can we detect if a user is a smart contract?
