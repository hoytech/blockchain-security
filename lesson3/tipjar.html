<h1>Lab 3: Tip-Jar</h1>

<div>Create a solidity program that accepts ETH from anybody (using a fallback function), but only the creator of the contract (the owner) can withdraw it. Your submission should be the solidity program.</div>

<ul>

<li>Use the remix IDE, as described in <a href="overflow.html">the previous exercise</a></li>

<li>
Verify that depositing to the tipjar by setting a value and clicking the <b>(fallback)</b> button decreases the balance of the sender:

</li>

<li>
Verify that an account other than the owner cannot withdraw:
<div><img src="tipjar-screen2.png" /></div>
</li>

<li>Verify that the owner can withdraw the tips.</li>

<li>Optional: In your contract, have a function that allows the owner to transfer ownership to another address.</li>

</ul>
