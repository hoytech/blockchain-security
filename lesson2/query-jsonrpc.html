<h1>Lab 3: Query JSON RPC Node</h1>

<div>
  Write a script in a language of your choice to find the balance in ETH of an account by querying a running ganachi-cli instance's JSON-RPC port (8545). Include the script in your submission.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>You need to do an HTTP POST request to http://localhost:8545</li> 
  <li>You will use the <a href="https://github.com/ethresearch/en-ethereum-wiki/blob/master/json-rpc.md#eth_getbalance">eth_getBalance</a> RPC method</li>
  <li>The body of the POST should be JSON, and should look like:
<div>
<pre>
{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["ADDRESS_GOES_HERE"]}
</pre>
</div>
  </li>
  <li>The output is in wei (there are 1e18 wei in 1 ETH), and is encoded in hexadecimal. Convert this to ETH and decimal.</li>
  <li>When you started ganachi-cli it printed out some addresses that were given ETH. Try to query those.</li>
  <li>What about other addresses? Does it throw an error for unknown addresses?</li>
</ul>
